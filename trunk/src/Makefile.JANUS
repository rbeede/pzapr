# You MUST compile with 32-bit mode (g++ -m32) because the Gladman AES library has a bug where it doesn't work
#	on 64-bit compiled mode.  See doc folder for more information.

# Tested with OpenMPI 1.4.3 running on Ubuntu 10.10 x64 and x86
#
# Your OpenMPI install must have been done after you added multilib support for 32-bit if you have Ubuntu x64
#
# Your OpenMPI install must also have been built in *32-BIT* mode, you may want separate installs for 32 & 64 bit
#
#	See http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2006/04/0992.php
#
#	SPECIAL NOTE:  You have to clear out ALL OF YOUR PATHS before you compile OpenMPI to flush out 64-bit libraries
